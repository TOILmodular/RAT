# RAT - A dual Eurorack distortion module
This module is a Eurorack version of the RAT guitar distortion pedal.
It contains two separate circuits, using the OP07N op amp.
The two inputs are normalled to each other.
Instead of a volume knob and a bypass switch given on the effect pedal, the module has a wet/dry mix knob for each channel to control the amount of distortion.
